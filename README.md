# Data Structures and Algorithms

Data structures and algorithms are some of the most essential topics for programmers, both to get a job and to do well on a job.

Good knowledge of data structures and algorithms is the foundation of writing good code.

If you are familiar with essential data structures e.g. array, string, linked list, tree, map, and advanced data structures like tries, and self-balanced trees like AVL trees, etc., you'll know when to use which data structure and compute the CPU and memory cost of your code.

Even though you don't need to write your own array, linked list, or hashtable, given every major programming SDK provides them, e.g. JDK or C++ STL library, you will need to understand them so that you can use them in the right place.

> Using the right data structure can drastically improve the performance of an algorithm.

we should all learn data structures and algorithms in our schools and colleges, but it's rarely ever covered. Most of the programmers, including myself, only get introduced to a data structure in our computer science courses, but we didn't really learn the real-world importance of them, and that's why we didn't understand them better.

For us, they are just the algorithms and data structures e.g. some concept, not a tool that you can use to write good programs. We didn't know that Facebook would use them to store our details or that Google would use them to store web pages and link to search queries.

Anyway, it's never too late.
