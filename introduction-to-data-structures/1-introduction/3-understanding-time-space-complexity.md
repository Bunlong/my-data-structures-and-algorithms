# Computational Complexity Analysis

### Complexity Analysis

As programmers, we often find ourselves asking the same two questions over and over again:

* How much time does this algorithm need to finish?
* How much space does this algorithm need for its computation?

### Big O notation

Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes how fast a function grows or declines.
