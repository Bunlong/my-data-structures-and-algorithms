### Discussion and examples about Arrays

#### What is an Array?

A static array is a fixed length container containing n elements indexable from the range [0, n-1].

Q: What is meant by being 'indexable'?
A: This means that each slot/index in the array can be referenced with a number.

#### When and where is a Array used?

1. Storing and accessing sequential data
2. Temporarily storing objects
3. Used by IO routines as buffers
4. Lookup tables and inverse lookup tables
5. Can be used to return multiple values from a function
6. Used in dynamic programming to cache answers to subprograms
